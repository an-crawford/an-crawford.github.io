excerpt: In this project, we compare different data sets and model types to see how they affect the accuracy of bird classification.

For our machine learning class, we decided to do Bird Classification. We used two sources of data, with one containing 'cleaned', easy-to-classify images, and the other containing mostly 'unclean' images with more noise. We also compared types of models, using convolutional neural networks and semi-supervised learning and seeing how accuracy changed.
