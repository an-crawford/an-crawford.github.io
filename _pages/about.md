Hello! My name is Andrew Crawford. I am a M.S. Analytics student at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, GA with an expected graduation date of August 2023. I am currently pursuing a career in the field of Data Science. 

I graduated in May 2022 with a B.S. in Statistics and a B.S. in Economics from the University of South Carolina's Honors College. There I was introduced to Data Science and fell in love with the field. I was a Data Analyics Intern at Palmetto GBA in the summer of 2021, where I used my skills in SAS and SQL to generate product reports. 

My data passions generally live in either sports or finance, so that will be the majority of the personal content on this website. The rest will consist of school projects that have showcased some of my skills.
