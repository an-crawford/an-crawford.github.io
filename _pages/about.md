Hello! My name is Andrew Crawford. I am a M.S. Analytics student at Georgia Tech, having graduating with a B.S. in Statistics and a B.S. in Economics from the University of South Carolina's Honors College. I am currently pursuing a career in the field of management consulting. 

My data passions generally live in either sports or finance, so that will be the majority of the content on this website. The rest will consist of school projects that showcased some of my skills.
